  /*
  Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.



  Example 1:

  Input: s = "abcabcbb"
  Output: 3
  Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
  Example 2:

  Input: s = "bbbbb"
  Output: 1
  Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
  Example 3:

  Input: s = "pwwkew"
  Output: 3
  Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
  Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


  Constraints:

  0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
  s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
